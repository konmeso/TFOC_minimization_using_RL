# TFOC_minimization_using_RL
The objective is the Total Fuel Oil Consumption (TFOC) minimization using Reinforcement Learning (RL). A predictive Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network was implemented for the accurate prediction of fuel consumption per ship's step. The Q-learning, DQN and Rainbow agents were compared.
